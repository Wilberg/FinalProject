                            The transition to studying at a university can be difficult. New
                            students often experience a loss of social circle as they move to another part of the
                            country, or many their friends move away. In both cases the students will experience a
                            significant change in routines, and it can be difficult to fit into their new situation,
                            and especially to find new friends. This is one of the reasons 23% of students say that
                            they miss someone to be with on a daily basis (Knapstad & Heradstveit & Sivertsen, 2018, p.
                            81).

                            Students are, from earlier forms of education, used to an environment
                            where you are more or less forced to socialize and get to know the people you study with.
                            In school it is very natural that the time in between classes is spent with the people you
                            study with; classes are small and very interactive, and there are frequent breaks in
                            between classes. University stands in contrast to this. The large amount of people that
                            attend a lecture mean that there is no way to have a meaningful amount of interactivity,
                            and students have to sit there in silence during the lecture. Consequently, it is very
                            difficult to get to know people during the lectures, and after the lectures is no better.
                            Students usually head home as soon as possible if there are no other responsibilities
                            holding them back.

                            The current answer to this is Fadderuka and the different student
                            unions. Fadderuka is a week with parties arranged for the new students. As popular as it is
                            among the students, it only lasts for a week, and if you have not found any people who you
                            click with at the end of the week, you may struggle to make friends in your new
                            environment. Furthermore, partying and drinking - the main activity during Fadderuka - is
                            not something that everyone enjoys.

                            The second solution currently available is the student unions, which
                            are based on people coming together based on a shared interest or studying the same course.
                            While this is a fairly good way to meet people, the barrier to entry may be too large for
                            some people. Going to an event where you know nobody may seem intimidating, something that
                            can make it difficult to attend for those students that need it the most.

                            Psychological well-being is important for academic success, and it
                            goes without saying that depression and other psychological disorders can have a
                            devastating impact on a student’s ability to study effectively. We humans are social
                            animals, and we do not function well without good relationships with others. Social ties
                            are essential for keeping good mental health, and therefore essential for succeeding in
                            one’s studies. And the importance of social ties does not stop with university, but
                            continue after graduation – good relationships are needed in order to live a good life.
